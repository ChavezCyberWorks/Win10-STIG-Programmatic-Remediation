**Windows Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs)** are configuration baselines developed by the [Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)](https://stigaview.com/products/win10/v3r4/) to strengthen system hardening and prevent unauthorized access.

This project documents the remediation efforts taken to bring a Windows 10 system into compliance using PowerShell-based automation.
